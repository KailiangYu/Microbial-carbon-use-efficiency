This repository contains data and code used to investigate the nonlinear microbial thermal response and its implications for abrupt soil organic carbon responses to warming.

There are five steps as described below.

Step 1: use the code 'Detrend.R' to derive the data on detrended CUE.

Step 2: use the code 'Figure1.R' to plot the distribution of samples on CUE and respiration. 

Step 3: use the code 'Figure2.R' to plot the nonlinear thermal response of soil microbial CUE with threshold values

Step 4: use the code 'Figure3.R' to show that nonlinear thermal response of soil microbial CUE is linked or partially contributed by soil heterotrophic respiration

Step 5: use the code 'Figure4.R' to show the influence of nonlinear thermal response of soil microbial CUE on the decay constant and SOC simulated at transient conditions
